# AR_Placement_Assesment_Vuforia_SDK
Simple AR minimalist dining table using the Vuforia SDK which uses a database of carpet image targets with a size of 1.5m x 2.5m to place virtual objects at real scale.

In this project I use Vuforia, which is an SDK provider for AR support where the features I use are the package (SDK) and target image database.
In addition, I also added a program for autofocus camera because not all smartphones use camera autofocus.
